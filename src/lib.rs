        //
        // - We're potentially casting from &[i8] to &[u8]. I believe this is
        //   always allowed. There's a possibility that it could behave
        //   differently on (extremely rare) one's complement systems, compared
        //   to (typical) two's complement systems. However, I don't think Rust
        //   even supports one's complement systems, and also "reinterpret the
        //   bit pattern as unsigned" is likely to be what the caller expects
        //   anyway.
        // - This buffer might be aliased. This is the main reason why
        //   PyByteArray::as_bytes is unsafe and why PyO3 uses the ReadOnlyCell
        //   type. If we mutated any other buffers, or ran any unknown Python
        //   code that could do anything (including any object finalizer), we
        //   could end up mutating this buffer too. Luckily we don't do either
        //   of those things in this module.
        // - We're breaking the lifetime relationship between this slice and
        //   `py`, because we're going to release the GIL during update. That
        //   means *other threads* might mutate this buffer.
        //
        // The last point above is the most serious. Python locks buffers to
        // prevent resizing while we're looking at them, so we don't need to
        // worry about out-of-bounds reads or use-after-free here, but it's
        // still possible for another thread to write to the bytes of the buffer
        // while we're reading them. In practice, the result of a race here is
        // "probably just junk bytes", but technically this violates the
        // requirements of the Rust memory model, and there may be obscure
        // circumstances (now or in the future) where it does something worse.
        //
        // However, this isn't just our problem. The standard hash
        // implementations in Python's hashlib have the same behavior, and you
        // can trigger a real data race with standard types like this:
        // https://gist.github.com/oconnor663/c69cb4dbffb9b13bbced3fe8ce2181ac.
        // This data race violates the requirements of the C memory model also.
        //
        // At the end of the day, even if this race turns out to be exploitable
        // (which appears unlikely), only pathological programs should be able
        // to trigger it. Writing to a buffer concurrently from another thread
        // while hashing it is a very weird thing to do, and it's almost

/// An incremental BLAKE3 hasher, which can accept any number of writes.

/// standard library.
///
/// Arguments:
/// - `data`: Input bytes to hash. Setting this to non-None is equivalent
///   to calling `update` on the returned hasher.
/// - `key`: A 32-byte key. Setting this to non-None enables the BLAKE3
///   keyed hashing mode.
/// - `derive_key_context`: A hardcoded, globally unique,
///   application-specific context string. Setting this to non-None enables
///   the BLAKE3 key derivation mode. `derive_key_context` and `key` cannot
///   be used at the same time.
/// - `max_threads`: The maximum number of threads that the implementation
///   may use for hashing. The default value is 1, meaning single-threaded.
///   `max_threads` may be any positive integer, or the value of the class
///   attribute `blake3.AUTO`, which lets the implementation use as many
///   threads as it likes. (Currently this means a number of threads equal
///   to the number of logical CPU cores, but this is not guaranteed.) The
///   actual number of threads used may be less than the maximum and may
///   change over time. API-compatible reimplementations of this library
///   may also ignore this parameter entirely, if they don't support
///   multithreading.
